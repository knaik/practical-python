Termux and git work well for cloning.

Markor seems to be perfect for offline reading of the notes. everything has rendered correctly

I wonder if it's worth doing the beginning exercises on jupyter

Quickedit on Android will probably be best, nano or vim through termux may work but....

Termux needs certain pkgs installed to work but everything is fine.


Chromebook should be easier to type on and the Android app compatibility should make Markor work. I have a chroot for git and python but termux should work. I want the ability to run jupyter lab from my chromebook and a xenial chroot makes it straightforward. 

I need to work on more organized commit messages in git. 

This works really well from my chromebook with a real keyboard. Quickedit is able to syntax highlight and save .py files

The course is easy to read and understand. It might help to read first and then do the exercises.
